# Runtime Revolution - Node.js Onboarding

A project built with the goal of helping new Runtimers on their first few weeks at [Runtime](https://runtime-revolution.com) by guiding them during the onboarding on the tech stack (JS; Node; React)

It's a simple next.js app.  The pages are created using `.mdx` to make the process of creating/editing content easy.  We are using the next.js *static export* feature to generate the build that is then published to github pages.

## Getting Started
